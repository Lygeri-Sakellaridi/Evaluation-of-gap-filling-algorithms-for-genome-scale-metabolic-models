Mischellaneous scripts for parsing/reformatting input data, for all tested algorithms.

1) bigg_to_cobra.py: Converts the BiGG reaction database in a format compatible with CobraToolbox/FastGapFill.

Input: the reactions' list from BiGG/Data Access. Can be found here: 
http://bigg.ucsd.edu/static/namespace/bigg_models_reactions.txt

2) make_model_fgf_dict: creates model-specific metabolite dictionary required for gap-filling. The resulting dictionary needs to be
curated for duplicate and missing values.
