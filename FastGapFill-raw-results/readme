Results from FastGapFill experiments, before analysis.

Each file contains the following results:

1. The solution set of reactions predicted by the algorithm, in mixed namespace (KEGG and BiGG).
2. The set of removed reactions, if applicable. 
3. A table with statistics; among other things, it contains the original number of blocked reactions,
and the fraction of those that have been successfully solved.
4. The growth rate (as calculated by fba) before and after degradation, if applicable.

The files whose names end with '_ori' result from gap-filling without any model degradation.
Consequently, results 2 and 4 are not applicable to them.
